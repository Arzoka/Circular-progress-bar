# Circular-progress-bar

Circular progress bar handler for my girlfriend's project, feel free to use it!

## How does it work?

Add ProgressBarHandler.js to your HTML and use it as following:

```html
<div
  class="r-progress first-progress"
  bg-color="#cddbcd"
  line-color="#548754"
  progress="67db"
  delay="1000"
></div>
```

delay refers to how long it takes for the animation to be completed, progress animates till 100 but it can go over, anything you put in the progress is shown in the middle and can be changed using css (see example)
